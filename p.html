<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<h2>A Web page is primarily made up of what three components?</h2>
<p>A Web page is primarily made up of text content, references to files and markup.</p>

<h2>What is the first line of code for any HTML5 Web page?</h2>
<p>The first line of code for any HTML5 Web page is &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</p>

<h2>The content inside &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; elements is invisible to the user with one exception. What is the exception?</h2>
<p>Except for content within the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; elements, content within &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; elements is invisible to the user.</p>

<h2>What is the role of HTML versus the role of CSS in a Web page?</h2>
<p>HTML is primarily used to structure content on a Web page, whereas CSS adds style to the Web page.</p>

<h2>How can you tell if an element is block-level or inline by default?</h2>
<p>Block-level elements cause a line break to occur. Inline elements, by default, do not create a new line in the content flow.</p>

<h2>If an element is block-level by default, how does it display on the screen?</h2>
<p>If an element is block-level by default, it will take up the entire space of its element thereby creating a block.</p>

<h2>List the four main reasons why semantics matter.</h2>
<p>The four main reasons semantics matter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better SEO &ndash; so that a website's content reaches the target audience.</li>
<li>Make the website more accessible to people, especially those with disabilities.</li>
<li>Make the site easier to maintain or understand for another developer &ndash; faster to change the appearance of content.</li>
<li>Web pages will load faster.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is an element?</h2>
<p>Elements represent semantics in HTML documents and describe the structure of the page. They mostly comprise opening and closing tags and any content that lies between the tags.</p>
<h2>If you have multiple spaces or tabs in your HTML, how does the browser treat them?</h2>
<p>The browser treats multiple spaces or tabs in HTML as a single space.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between an absolute URL and a relative URL?</h2>
<p>An absolute URL uses the entire address of the page as a link. This protects content from being scraped, and being viewed as duplicate when there are different versions of root domains. A relative URL uses just the page as a link, indicating a page in an existing domain. This makes it easier and faster for web developers to code, and is better suited for staging environments where websites need to be duplicated.</p>
<h2>Why is a site's home page often named index.html?</h2>
<p>A site's home page is often named index.html as a default page the server can pull up if no specific file is requested.</p>
<h2>What are the two main sections of a Web page? Describe the purpose of each section.</h2>
<p>The two main sections of a Web page are the header which usually consists of a navigation bar to access different pages on the site and the main content page which carries all the information the website was intended for.</p>
<h2>How many heading levels does HTML5 provide?</h2>
<p>HTML5 provides 6 heading levels.</p>
<h2>Why would you use a header element?</h2>
<p>The header element is used to define the header of a page. It usually contains the logo, a search bar and a navigation bar for different pages of the website.</p>
<h2>Why would you use a nav element?</h2>
<p>The nav element is used to provide navigation links either within the current document or to other documents.</p>
<h2>Why would you use an article element?</h2>
<p>The article element is used for independent pieces of content that can also be distributed.</p>
<h2>Why would you use a section element?</h2>
<p>Section elements are used to group together related elements.</p>
<h2>Why would you use an aside element?</h2>
<p>Aside elements are used for sectioning content that could be related to the main content of the page, but is still separate from it.</p>
<h2>Why would you use a footer element?</h2>
<p>Footer elements are used for the footer of a page, which typically contains copyright information and certain links related to the page.</p>
<h2>Why would you use a div element?</h2>
<p>Div elements encapsulate other page elements and divide the html document into sections. Web developers can group these sections together to apply CSS styles to multiple elements at once.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between an id attribute and a class attribute?</h2>
<p>An id attribute can be used to identify one element whereas a class attribute can be used to identify multiple elements.</p>
